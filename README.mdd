FC Barcelona Database Project

This is a university project I completed during my Introduction to Databases course. The goal was to create a full database system for a real-world organization. I chose FC Barcelona and focused on their financial data, building a small-scale database solution that includes schema creation, data insertion, querying, and analysis.

Project Overview

- I started by writing the concept and goals of the project.
- Then I created the database schema using SQL, followed by inserting data manually.
- After the database was ready, I ran queries to extract insights.
- I also created a few visualizations using Python to make the analysis clearer.
- Finally, I put together a presentation based on the results.

What's Inside

- docs – The concept document and FC Barcelona’s financial report for context.
- sql – SQL scripts for creating the database, inserting data, and running queries.
- visualizations – Graphs and a Jupyter notebook with Python code.
- presentation – A PowerPoint and notes for presenting the project.

 Tools Used

- SQL (SQLite)
- Python (Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib)
- PowerPoint

 What I Learned

This project helped me practice everything from writing SQL to working with real data and explaining the results in a simple way. It also improved how I present technical work to others.
